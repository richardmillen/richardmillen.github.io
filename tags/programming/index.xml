      <description>! W O R K ~ I N ~ P R O G R E S S ! Quiz 1      What&amp;rsquo;s the best way to pass an array to a function?   Show Answers  1. The runtime sends os.Signal events in a nonblocking way.
If a goroutine isn&amp;rsquo;t ready to recieve the value it&amp;rsquo;s thrown away.
e.g. If the user hits Ctrl+C repeatedly, the program will receive the event only when a buffer is available in the channel and all other events will be thrown away.</description>
