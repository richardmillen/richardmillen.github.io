      <description>I am a technologist, writer, musician and family man who has spent more than 15 years building software systems.
I believe in building software that accurately solves real problems.
I&amp;rsquo;ve built Android apps, Websites, distributed messaging systems, desktop applications and an arduino-based product prototype.
Although I do venture into web and mobile development, I spend most of my time and energy building desktop and backend systems in languages like Go, C++, C#, Python etc.</description>
