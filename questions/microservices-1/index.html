<p>Consider service templates to make it easy to do the right thing.</p>

<h4 id="2">2.</h4>

<p>If a service is not responding in a timely manner, a software circuit breaker will be thrown so that consumers don&rsquo;t have to waste time waiting for timeout values to occur.<br />
It can be implemented to reset itself when the service starts responding or becomes available.</p>

<h4 id="5">5.</h4>

<p>Microservices architectures have a limited service taxonomy when it comes to service type classification, mostly consisting of two types:</p>

<ul>
<li>functional - accessed externally, generally not shared with any other service.</li>
<li>infrastructure - not exposed to outside world, treated as private shared services, only available internally to other services.</li>

<p>Start with services that are more coarse-grained than you might otherwise create, then break them apart as you learn how they are used.</p>

<h4 id="2">2.</h4>

<p>Built on the concept of a share-as-little-as-possible architecture style.<br />
Leverages a concept from domain-driven design called a bounded context.<br />
This is the exact opposite to SOA.</p>

<h4 id="3">3.</h4>

<p>Favour service choreography over service orchestration, primarily because of the lack of a centralised middleware component.</p>

<h4 id="4">4.</h4>

<p>Should try to minimise amount of service choreography in your architecture, restricting interactions to those between functional services and infrastructure services.<br />
Because microservices architecture is a share-as-little-as-possible architecture.</p>

<h4 id="5">5.</h4>

<p>If you find you need a lot of service choreography between functional services, chances are they&rsquo;re too fine-grained.</p>

<p>Too much choreography can lead to high efferent coupling - the degree to which one component is dependent on other components to complete a single business request.</p>

<h4 id="2">2.</h4>

<p>SOA typically relies on multiple services (and service types) to complete a single business request.</p>

<h4 id="3">3.</h4>

<p>Does not support the concept of messaging middleware.
Supports the notion of an API layer in front of services.</p>

<h4 id="4">4.</h4>

<p>Forms an abstraction layer so that consumers don&rsquo;t need to know locations of endpoints.<br />
Allows you to change service granularity without impacting consumers.</p>

<h4 id="5">5.</h4>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t because it doesn&rsquo;t use a messaging middleware.</p>

  <h4 id="1">1.</h4>

<p>The number of technology and architecture choices is generally limted to a few options.</p>

<h4 id="2">2.</h4>

<p>Most microservices architectures usually rely on only two different remote-access protocols:</p>

<ol>
<li>REST</li>
<li>Simple messaging e.g. JMS, MSMQ, AMQP etc.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="3">3.</h4>

<p>The remote access protocol in microservices is usually homogeneous.<br />
One exception is the case in which services that rely on publish-and-subscribe broadcast capabilities might be message-based, whereas other services might be REST-based.</p>

<h4 id="4">4.</h4>

<p>The microservices pattern is better suited for smaller, well-partitioned web-based systems rather than large-scale enterprise-wide systems.</p>

<h4 id="5">5.</h4>

<p>The lack of a mediator.</p>

  <br/>
  <div id="q9" style="display: none;">
  
  <h4 id="1">1.</h4>

<p>In some cases the microservices pattern is a good initial architecture choice.<br />
As the business grows more SOA-type capabilities such as request transformation, orchestration and heterogeneous system integration may be needed.<br />
Of course, the opposite is also true.</p>

<h4 id="2">2.</h4>

<p>By reducing the number of choices for services integration.<br />
REST and simple messaging are two of the most common remote-access protocols used.</p>

<h4 id="3">3.</h4>

<p>The architecture can support multiple types of remote access protocols, but the communication between consumer and service must be the same e.g. REST.</p>

<h4 id="4">4.</h4>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t because it doesn&rsquo;t use a messaging middleware.</p>

<h4 id="5">5.</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Town planners.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The city changes over time.<br />
Looks at a multitude of sources of information, and then attempt to optimize the layout of a city to best suit the needs of the citizens today, taking into account future use.<br />
Define city zones - you might designate part of your city as an industrial zone, and another part as a residential zone.<br />
If you want to build a factory, it will need to be in an industrial zone.<br />
Rather than worrying too much about what happens in one zone, the town planner will instead spend far more time working out how people and utilities move from one zone to another.</p>

The whole point of a microservice is being able to make a change to one service and deploy it, without needing to change any other part of the system.</p>

<h4 id="3">3.</h4>

<p>We want to find boundaries within our problem domain that help ensure that related behavior is in one place, and that communicate with other boundaries as loosely as possible.</p>

<h4 id="4">4.</h4>

<p>Prematurely decomposing a system into microservices can be costly, especially if you are new to the domain.</p>

<h4 id="5">5.</h4>

<p>When considering the boundaries of your microservices, first think in terms of the larger, coarser-grained contexts, and then subdivide along these nested contexts when youâ€™re looking for the benefits of splitting out these seams.<br />
Whether you choose the nested approach over the full separation approach should be based on your organizational structure.<br />
If related contexts are managed by different teams, they probably deserve their status as top-level microservices. If, on the other hand, all of them are managed by one team, then the nested model makes more sense.</p>

<p>If our systems are decomposed along the bounded contexts that represent our domain, the changes we want to make are more likely to be isolated to one, single microservice boundary. This reduces the number of places we need to make a change, and allows us to deploy that change quickly.</p>

<h4 id="2">2.</h4>

<p>Due to the nature of mobile networks and devices, firing off requests and assuming things have worked (unless told otherwise) can ensure that the UI remains responsive even if the network is highly laggy.</p>

<h4 id="3">3.</h4>

<p>With an event-based collaboration, we invert things. Instead of a client initiating requests asking for things to be done, it instead says this thing happened and expects other parties to know what to do. We never tell anyone else what to do. Event-based systems by their nature are asynchronous. The smarts are more evenly distributedâ€”that is, the business logic is not centralized into core brains, but instead pushed out more evenly to the various collaborators. Event-based collaboration is also highly decoupled. The client that emits an event doesnâ€™t have any way of knowing who or what will react to it, which also means that you can add new subscribers to these events without the client ever needing to know.</p>

<h4 id="4">4.</h4>

<p>With a choreographed approach, we could instead just have the customer service emit an event in an asynchronous manner, saying Customer created. The email service, postal service, and loyalty points bank then just subscribe to these events and react accordingly, as in FigureÂ 4-4. This approach is significantly more decoupled. If some other service needed to reach to the creation of a customer, it just needs to subscribe to the events and do its job when needed. The downside is that the explicit view of the business process we see in FigureÂ 4-2 is now only implicitly reflected in our system</p>

<h4 id="5">5.</h4>

<p>This means additional work is needed to ensure that you can monitor and track that the right things have happened. For example, would you know if the loyalty points bank had a bug and for some reason didnâ€™t set up the correct account? One approach I like for dealing with this is to build a monitoring system that explicitly matches the view of the business process in FigureÂ 4-2, but then tracks what each of the services does as independent entities, letting you see odd exceptions mapped onto the more explicit process flow.</p>

<p>Systems that tend more toward the choreographed approach are more loosely coupled, and are more flexible and amenable to change.

<p>A model for client libraries I like is the one for Amazon Web Services (AWS). The underlying SOAP or REST web service calls can be made directly, but everyone ends up using just one of the various software development kits (SDKs) that exist, which provide abstractions over the underlying API.<br />
These SDKs, though, are written by the community or AWS people other than those who work on the API itself.</p>

<p>The client libraries used by Netflix are as much (if not more) about ensuring reliability and scalability of their systems. The Netflix client libraries handle service discovery, failure modes, logging, and other aspects that arenâ€™t actually about the nature of the service itself.</p>

<h4 id="3">3.</h4>

<p>Make sure that the clients are in charge of when to upgrade their client libraries: we need to ensure we maintain the ability to release our services independently of each other.</p>

<h4 id="4">4.</h4>

<p>Consider the example where we ask the email service to send an email when an order has been shipped. Now we could send in the request to the email service with the customerâ€™s email address, name, and order details. However, if the email service is actually queuing up these requests, or pulling them from a queue, things could change in the meantime. It might make more sense to just send a URI for the Customer and Order resources, and let the email server go look them up when it is time to send the email.</p>

<h4 id="5">5.</h4>

<p>Consider event-based collaboration. With events, weâ€™re saying this happened, but we need to know what happened. If weâ€™re receiving updates due to a Customer resource changing, for example, it could be valuable to us to know what the Customer looked like when the event occurred. As long as we also get a reference to the entity itself so we can look up its current state, then we can get the best of both worlds.</p>

<p>Rather than having our UI make API calls and map everything back to UI controls, we could have our services provide parts of the UI directly, and then just pull these fragments in to create a UI.<br />

<p>Our packages representing the bounded contexts in our organization should interact in the same way the real-life organizational groups in our domain interact.<br />
If package A depends on code in package B when no such dependency exists in the real organisation then we can investigate and resolve it.</p>

<h4 id="2">2.</h4>

<p>We want to pull out the seam that is least depended on if we can.<br />
View the various seams you have found as a directed acyclical graph of dependencies.</p>

<h4 id="3">3.</h4>

<p>We need to find seams in our databases too so we can split them out cleanly.<br />
Look at the code itself and see which parts of it read to and write from the database.<br />
Common practice is to have a repository layer.<br />
Group our database access code into packages representing our bounded contexts. This may require splitting up the repository layer into several parts.<br />
You also need to view the relationships between tables. This helps you understand the coupling between tables that may span what will eventually become service boundaries.</p>

<h4 id="4">4.</h4>

<p>e.g.</p>

<ul>
<li>At the end of each month we need to generate reports for various people in the organization so they can see how weâ€™re doing.</li>
<li>Our reporting code in the finance package will reach into the line item table (in the catalog package) to pull out the title for the SKU.</li>
<li>May also have a foreign key constraint from the ledger to the line item table.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stop the finance code from reaching into the line item table.</p>

<ul>
<li>Weâ€™ll expose the data via an API call in the catalog package that the finance code can call.</li>
<li>This API call will be the forerunner of a call we will make over the wire.</li>
<li>We may well end up having to make two database calls to generate the report.</li>
<li>How fast does your system need to be? How fast is it now?</li>
<li>You can test its current performance and know what good performance looks like.</li>
<li>The foreign key relationship is lost altogether and becomes a constraint we need to manage in our service rather than at the database level.</li>
<li>Implement consistency check across services or else trigger actions to clean up related data.</li>
<li>This is often not a technologist&rsquo;s choice to make.</li>

<p>This is a domain concept that isnâ€™t modeled in the code, and is in fact implicitly modeled in the database.<br />

<h4 id="3">3.</h4>

<p>I recommend that you split out the database schema but keep the service together before splitting the application code out into separate microservices.<br />
Weâ€™ll be potentially increasing the number of database calls to perform a single action.<br />
We break transactional integrity when we move to two schemas.<br />
By splitting the schemas out but keeping the application code together, we give ourselves the ability to revert our changes or continue to tweak things without impacting any consumers of our service.<br />
Once we are satisfied that the DB separation makes sense, we can then think about splitting out the application code into separate services.</p>

<p>Two-phase commit.<br />
First comes the voting phase. This is where each participant (also called a cohort in this context) in the distributed transaction tells the transaction manager whether it thinks its local transaction can go ahead.<br />
If the transaction manager gets a yes vote from all participants, then it tells them all to go ahead and perform their commits.<br />
A single no vote is enough for the transaction manager to send out a rollback to all parties.</p>

<h4 id="2">2.</h4>

<p>If the transaction manager goes down, the pending transactions never complete.<br />
If a cohort fails to respond during voting, everything blocks.<br />
What happens if a commit fails after voting?<br />
Pending transactions can hold locks on resources. Locks on resources can lead to contention, making scaling systems much more difficult.</p>

<h4 id="3">3.</h4>

<p>When you encounter business operations that currently occur within a single transaction, ask yourself if they really need to. Can they happen in different, local transactions, and rely on the concept of eventual consistency? These systems are much easier to build and scale than using distributed transactions.</p>

<h4 id="4">4.</h4>

<p>Do everything you can to avoid splitting it up in the first place.<br />
If you really need to go ahead with the split, think about moving from a purely technical view of the process (e.g., a database transaction) and actually create a concrete concept to represent the transaction itself.<br />
This gives you a handle, or a hook, on which to run other operations like compensating transactions, and a way to monitor and manage these more complex concepts in your system.<br />
For example, you might create the idea of an &ldquo;in-process-order&rdquo; that gives you a natural place to focus all logic around processing the order end to end (and dealing with exceptions).</p>

<p>With well-defined structure, you can easily map the builds to certain parts of the source tree. In general, I am not a fan of this approach, as this model can be a mixed blessing. On the one hand, my check-in/check-out process can be simpler as I have only one repository to worry about. On the other hand, it becomes very easy to get into the habit of checking in source code for multiple services at once, which can make it equally easy to slip into making changes that couple services together.

Each microservice has its own source code repository, mapped to its own CI build.</p>

<h4 id="3">3.</h4>

<p>Create what is known as a build pipeline. One stage for the faster tests, one for the slower tests.</p>

<h4 id="4">4.</h4>

<p>When a team is starting out with a new project, especially a greenfield one where they are working with a blank sheet of paper, it is quite likely that there will be a large amount of churn in terms of working out where the service boundaries lie. This is a good reason, in fact, for keeping your initial services on the larger side until your understanding of the domain stabilizes.<br />
Changes across service boundaries are more likely, and what is in or not in a given service is likely to change frequently. During this period, having all services in a single build to reduce the cost of cross-service changes may make sense.<br />
In this case you need to buy into releasing all the services as a bundle.<br />
As service APIs stabilize, start moving them out into their own builds.<br />
If after some time you are unable to get stability in service boundaries in order to properly separate them, merge them back into a more monolithic service (albeit retaining modular separation within the boundary) and give yourself time to get to grips with the domain.</p>

<p>Someone comes along, logs into the box, and changes things independently of what is in source control.</p>
